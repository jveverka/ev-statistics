# EV statistics calculations

Simple script to calculate EV trip statistics for a single trip data file recorder using [Car Scanner ELM OBD2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovz.carscanner&hl=en&gl=US) 
app connected to EV via [ELM327](https://www.alza.sk/mobilly-obd-ii-bt-d4624328.htm) OBD bluetooth adapter. One CSV file is one trip.

To calculate statistics from data file:
```
./ev-stats.py <data-file.csv>
```
